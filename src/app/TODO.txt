Note about importing angular modules:
- when you import module because of services, you that only ONCE, in the main module.
- if you import it because of template-related things, then you need to import it in EACH module, where it is used.

- services provided in lazy-loaded module, will be available only in that module. Because they became part of diferent bundle.

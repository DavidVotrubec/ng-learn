each Angular Module should have its own routing
NgModuel is the unit of reusability


TODO: What is @Input for? 
build a component which utilizes that

Note about importing angular modules:
- when you import module because of services, you that only ONCE, in the main module.
- if you import it because of template-related things, then you need to import it in EACH module, where it is used.
- Avoid importing service modules more then once. It may lead to errors and degrade performance.
- services provided in lazy-loaded module, will be available only in that module. Because they became part of diferent bundle.

What is a difference between Directive and Component?
It seems that directive is for attributes only?
component is a special-case of directive.
Directive can be attached to another directive and it should be highly reusable. 
Components force isolated scope and encourage one-way binding. Component also uses Shadow DOM.
@View or TemplateUrl is mandatory for a Component. 
While Directive only modifies of add functionality of existing elements.

-----------------------------------------
Decorators:

- Class decorators, e.g. @Component and @NgModule
- Property decorators for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output
- Method decorators for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener
- Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject


-----------------------------------------
Dependency Injection:
 @Injectable is required if the class (service) has dependencies on some other services, such as Http.
 Without that annotation, Angular can not compose that instance correctly.
 So to avoid possible problems, it is better to always add the @Injectable.
 OR be clever and add it only when there are some dependencies
